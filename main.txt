Network analysis refers to a family of methods that describe relationships between units of analysis. A network is comprised of nodes as well as the edges or connections between them. In a social network—such as the one in the figure below—nodes are often individual people, and edges describe friendships, affiliations, or other types of social relationships. A rich theoretical tradition in the social sciences describes how patterns of clustering within social networks—and an individual’s position within or between clusters— is associated with a remarkably wide range of outcomes including health, employment, education, and many others.
